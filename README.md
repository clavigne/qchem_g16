# qchem_g16

> ðŸ”¥ Gaussian 16 x QChem ðŸ˜® !
> The latest, hottest, limited collab from your favourite #brands! 

Run QChem under the control of Gaussian 16 with `qchem_g16`.

For example, you can use `qchem_g16` to leverage Gaussian's excellent TS
optimization algos and QChem's fast integral evaluations.

## Installation

`qchem_g16` is available as a statically-linked linux binary. Just download it
and put it somewhere on `$PATH`.

On other platforms, you can build it using [Cargo and rustc,](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clavigne/qchem_g16
cd qchem_g16
cargo --build --release
```

## Usage

The `qchem_g16` binary is a well-behaved [Gaussian external
program.](https://gaussian.com/external/) It requires only one supplemental
argument `--rem FILE`, where `FILE` is a QChem input file containing a `$rem`
group. For example, the Gaussian input would look like this,

```
%NProcShared=4
# external="qchem_g16 --rem params.rem"
  opt=(calcfc, noraman)

H          1.56346        1.92540        0.02438

```

and the QChem input (`params.rem`) like this,

```
$rem
method hf
basis 6-31g
$end
```

Provided that `qchem` and `qchem_g16` are both on `$PATH`, running `g16` on
this file will optimize benzene but with energy, gradient and Hessian
evaluations done by QChem.

Q-Chem will automatically use as many threads as `%NProcShared`. 

## Features

- [X] Run Q-Chem as an external program from Gaussian.
- [X] Correct number of threads for Q-Chem.
- [X] Provides energies, gradients and Hessians.
- [ ] Provides dipole moments and polarizability.
- [X] Works with implicit solvation models.
